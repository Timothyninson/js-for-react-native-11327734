- function: processArray(numbers): This function takes an array of numbers and made use of `for loops` for iteration.
- The loop checks if the respective numbers in the array are even or odd using the modulo operator. 
- If the number is even, it returns the square of that number
- If the number is odd, it returns the cube of that number

# Task 2
-file : arrayManipulation.js
-function : formatArrayStrings(strings, mynumbers): This fumction takes an array of numbers(from the processArray function) and an array of strings and makes use of `for loops`.
- If the number in the mynumbers array is even, the function capitalizes the corresponding string in the array of strings.
- If the number in the mynumbers array is odd, the function makes the corresponding string in the array of strings lower case.

# Task 3
